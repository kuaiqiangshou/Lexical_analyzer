# Lexical_analyzer
The analyzer.py file is my whole program for lexical analyzer.

The input_program.txt file store the code we need to analyze.

These two files need to put in the same path.

Or you can change the read path of this txt file in line “19” and line ”32” of the analyzer.py file.

Thank you!
